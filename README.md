# inclusive-language

A repository for quickly checking your docs with [Vale](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/) for words that could be changed to more inclusive language.
Based on the work done by the Kubernetes Naming Work Group.

You can run this by installing [Vale](https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/installation), cloning this repo, then running Vale in the following way:

```sh
cd inclusive-language
